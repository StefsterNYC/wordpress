# WordPress Projects and Customizations

This repository contains various WordPress-related customizations, tools, and plugins developed or curated by StefsterNYC.

## Structure

- **/speculation/**  
  WordPress plugin to toggle speculationrules for accurate Lighthouse audits.  
  Allows you to temporarily disable speculationrules to prevent Chrome DevTools crashes during audits.

- (Other folders and projects can be added here as needed.)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of WordPress enhancements, audit tools, performance optimizations, and custom code.

## Notes

- All projects are structured to be modular.
- Each plugin or tool typically has its own `README.md` inside its folder explaining its individual purpose.
- No automatic WordPress.org submissions â€” all code is managed independently.
